      <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What went wrong in the development process?</strong>
          We started off significantly slower than we should have which put us a little behind from the start. Losing a team member during the first iteration also didnâ€™t help us too much. We found out later on that instead of 4 full stack developers (despite the bus factor), we worked better by splitting up the work based on what we were more efficient at.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?</strong>
          If we could start over, we would start with the different work structure as described above. It made us work much faster when one person focused on presentation, one for backend, one for testing, etc.
      </p>
      <p>  
        <strong>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</strong>
          Figuring out the presentation layer probably took us the most time as Android Studio was new for most of our team. Some Android specific features caused us a lot of trouble when debugging, especially the adapter mechanism, although it  is convenient and flexible for implementing UI components. Everyone had java experience and the logic/persistence layer closely resembled basic java so that implementation was the least time consuming, relatively speaking, due to prior knowledge of fundamentals. 
      </p>
      <p>
One area of improvement that we decided would benefit us the most was splitting up responsibilities as we noticed certain people worked much more quickly on certain parts of the application. This was a good decision as it improved our velocity by quite a bit.
