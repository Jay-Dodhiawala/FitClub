        <h2>Vision Statement</h2>
        <p class="heroP">
          FitClub will is an app to plan or build workout routines and learn gym
          exercises. It provides a selection of pre-built workout plans, allows
          for workout plan customization, and provides guides for performing
          various exercises. FitClub is designed for gym goers of all ability
          levels looking for a structured workout experience. The app allows gym
          goers to plan their workout routines before they start exercising to
          increase overall gym time efficiency and improve workout quality. The
          app encourages more time exercising and less time deciding which
          exercises to do. For gym goers with little or no gym experience, this
          app provides a structured workout program through the availability of
          ready-made workout plans. Some of the major functions of the app are
          the ability to search exercises and add them to a favourites list,
          which allows users to find their favourite exercises quickly. Another
          one is the being able to plan a workout, which allows gym goers to
          create their own workout routine so they can select exercises that
          they enjoy doing more than others.

      <h2>Post Mortem</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>What went wrong in the development process?</strong>
        <br />We started off significantly slower than we should have which put
        us a little behind from the start. Losing a team member during the first
        iteration also didnâ€™t help us too much. We found out later on that
        instead of 4 full stack developers (despite the bus factor), we worked
        better by splitting up the work based on what we were more efficient at.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>
          What would you do differently, if you had the chance to start over?
        </strong>
        <br />If we could start over, we would start with the different work
        structure as described above. It made us work much faster when one
        person focused on presentation, one for backend, one for testing, etc.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>What took the most time? The least? Any surprises?</strong>
        <br />Figuring out the presentation layer probably took us the most time
        as Android Studio was new for most of our team. Some Android specific
        features caused us a lot of trouble when debugging, especially the
        adapter mechanism, although it is convenient and flexible for
        implementing UI components. Everyone had java experience and the
        logic/persistence layer closely resembled basic java so that
        implementation was the least time consuming, relatively speaking, due to
        prior knowledge of fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>
        One area of improvement that we decided would benefit us the most was
        splitting up responsibilities as we noticed certain people worked much
        more quickly on certain parts of the application. This was a good
        decision as it improved our velocity by quite a bit.
