    <section class="postmortem">
      <p>
        A postmortem of your development experience, where you discuss some of
        the issues that arose during the development of your process. You can
        (and should) include both negative and positive points; they will not
        count against your project mark. It is highly recommended that you
        include the last three items from the list above. Also ensure that you
        discuss the area you identified for improvement after your iteration 2
        retrospective; how did it go? This should be informal, you can choose
        two or three of the following items to discuss, or something else you
        find interesting or relevant: What was the overall architecture of your
        system (particularly if it is different from the demo system)? What went
        right in the development process?
      </p>
      <div class="v_chat">
        <img src="v_chat.jpg" alt="test" />
      </div>
      <p>
        What went wrong in the development process? What would you do
        differently, if you had the chance to start over? How large is the
        project (number of methods, classes, etc)? How much of this is (roughly)
        devoted to each major system component? And any other quantifiables
        (e.g. if you have a record of hours spent on tasks). What took the most
        time? The least? Any surprises? Are there any particular design smells,
        or brilliant design decisions? Are there any outstanding bugs? Did any
        features work better than expected? Are you using any technologies other
        than what was required (e.g. JMock, GUI builders, etc.)? Are you using
        any specific techniques covered in the course (TDD, pair programming,
        scrums, etc)? How did the project change from your initial (iteration 0)
        vision or stories, or did it work out as predicted? What did you learn
        about team or large project development? What will you start doing, keep
        doing, or stop doing next time? Can you draw any conclusions from what
        youâ€™ve done? Remember, as with the retrospectives, avoid pointing
        fingers at individuals to explain flaws, even indirectly. This was a
        group effort and everyone takes responsibility for the outcome.
